    <h2> Bootcamp Introduction to Web Development Tools</h2>
    <h1> BIM and Smart Construction 2022 </h1>

    <div>
    <p class="heading-10">This is my own heading</p>
    <p class="special-items">In this course you will learn about the basics of web development tools.</p>
    </div>

    <p id="nice"> First you will learn about a tool for version control called <em>Git</em>, which 
    can be extended to the web <span class="special">through</span> a server for respositories called <a href="www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>.
    Along with it you will be introduce to the  glorified text editor <strong>Visual 
    Studio Code</strong>, which allows you write and debug code in the browser through
    a web server. </p>

    <p>In the following sessions, you will learn the <span class="special">basics</span> about the three main
    componentes for modern web development:</p>

    
    <ol>

        <li>HTML       </li>     
        <li>CSS        </li>
        <li>Javascript </li>

    </ol>

    <p class="special-items">Finally (if we have enough time left), you will be introduced to Github Pages,
    a feature that  will allow you to host your sites in the web through Github.</p>
